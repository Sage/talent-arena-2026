    "# 📚 What You Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Traditional Agents** have coupled tools that are hardcoded\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **MCP Architecture** decouples tools from agents\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **MCPServerBuilder** makes it easy to create MCP servers\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Tool Packs** provide pre-built functionality (filesystem, database, actions, grapher)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **MCPToolsWrapper** connects agents to MCP servers\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Tool selection matters** - choosing the right tools is key to solving problems!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explore the code**: Look at `lab.py` to see how the tools work\n",
    "2. **Try different challenges**: Create other types of charts (pie, line)\n",
    "3. **Understand the data flow**: Query → Transform → Visualize\n",
    "4. **Build your own tools**: Modify `mcp_servers.py` to add custom tools\n",

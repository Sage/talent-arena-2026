    "## 📚 What You Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **MCP Architecture**: Server/client model with stdio transport  \n",
    "✅ **Tool Discovery**: Using `list_tools()` to discover available capabilities  \n",
    "✅ **Tool Execution**: Calling tools with `call_tool()` and handling responses  \n",
    "✅ **AI Integration**: Connecting MCP tools to an LLM agent (ReAct pattern)  \n",
    "✅ **Subprocess Model**: Running servers as isolated processes\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explore the code**: Read `mcp_servers.py` to understand how tools are implemented\n",
    "2. **Add more tools**: Try the Challenge 4 exercise to extend the server\n",
    "3. **Connect to real services**: Replace simulated tools with real API calls\n",
    "4. **Build your own agent**: Customize `mcpagentDef.py` for your use case\n",
    "5. **Try MCP with other LLMs**: The protocol works with any AI model!\n",

    "- ✅ Make tool usage explicit: \"FIRST, use [tool_name]...\"\n",

    "- ✅ Explain WHY to use each tool\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue: Agent repeats the same action**\n",
    "- ✅ Add progression logic: \"AFTER [action], move to [next_action]\"\n",
    "- ✅ Prevent loops: \"DO NOT call [tool] more than once\"\n",
    "- ✅ Define clear stopping conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue: Inconsistent or poor output format**\n",
    "- ✅ Provide an exact template: \"You MUST use this format:\"\n",
    "- ✅ Show a concrete example in the prompt\n",
    "- ✅ Use strong language: \"ALWAYS include...\", \"NEVER omit...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue: Agent does too much or too little**\n",
    "- ✅ Add conditional logic: \"IF [condition], THEN [action], ELSE [other_action]\"\n",
    "- ✅ Set clear boundaries: \"ONLY search news if...\"\n",
    "- ✅ Define efficiency rules: \"Limit to X tool calls\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue: Agent \"forgets\" previous information**\n",
    "- ✅ Add state tracking: \"Keep track of all data you collect\"\n",
    "- ✅ Make memory explicit: \"After each step, note: [key: value]\"\n",
    "- ✅ Reference previous observations: \"Use the price you found earlier...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue: Wrong workflow or sequencing**\n",
    "- ✅ Number your steps: \"Step 1: [action]. Step 2: [action]...\"\n",
    "- ✅ Be MORE explicit about the entire workflow\n",
    "- ✅ Define dependencies: \"You can't do Y until you've done X\"\n"

            "### 📊 Analysis:\n",
            "NVIDIA is experiencing a notable decline of nearly 5% today, a significant move that warrants attention. Despite the stock's drop, the underlying business fundamentals remain strong — the company recently reported earnings that topped analyst expectations. This classic \"sell the news\" behavior suggests investors may be locking in profits following the earnings release, even as growth forecasts remain robust.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 📰 Market Context:\n",
            "- **Earnings Beat, Stock Slides:** NVIDIA's latest quarterly results exceeded expectations, but growth showed signs of slowing, triggering a sell-off — a common reaction in high-expectation growth stocks.\n",
            "- **Analyst Sentiment Remains Bullish:** Seeking Alpha analysts are calling the post-earnings dip a buying opportunity, citing CEO Jensen Huang's continued elevation of AI infrastructure targets.\n",

            "The ~5% dip appears to be a post-earnings sentiment correction rather than a fundamental deterioration — long-term investors may view this as a potential entry point into the leading AI infrastructure play.\n",

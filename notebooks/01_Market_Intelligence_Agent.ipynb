    "\n",
    "- **Compare multiple stocks**: run the agent on a list of symbols and compare movements side-by-side\n",
    "- **Add volume analysis**: extend the prompt to flag unusual trading volume alongside price change\n",
    "- **Add a chart**: use `generate_chart` to visualize price changes across a portfolio of symbols\n",
    "- **Track a portfolio**: run the agent daily on a watchlist and generate a summary report\n",
    "- **Set alert logic**: add a condition in the prompt to flag moves > 5% as high-priority alerts\n",
    "- **Generate daily reports**: chain `get_stock_price` + `search_news` across multiple tickers automatically\n",
